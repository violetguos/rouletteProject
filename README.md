# rouletteProject

A roulette game built using Lego blocks, Lego controller, Altera FPGA

  - It deslays the rules
  - Let the user input the bet from keyboard
  - Plays music in the end


### Programming languages, algorithms, and hardware


* [C] - To implement a random number generator using linear-feedback shift register 
* [Assembly] - we configured a motor(which runs in 3 speed modes to mimic a real roulette), audio, and timer(on FPGA)



### P. S.

I neglected the image and audio files in the repo
